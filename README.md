# ScheduleIt
ScheduleIt is an ongoing full stack JavaScript web application that allows users to easily schedule recurring meetings or events with others.

The primary use case behind the application was to provide a way for freelance teachers/instructors to easily expose their availability to prospective students who can select meeting times in a seamless and user friendly manner.
